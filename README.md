Objective: Verify logic circuits through VHDL simulation.
Skills Covered: Testbench writing, waveform analysis, simulation in ISim.
Description: Students design basic logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and simulate them using ISim. Waveforms are analyzed to confirm correct functionality. This lab builds confidence in debugging and 
verifying designs before hardware testing.
